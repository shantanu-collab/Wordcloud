Hey! folks,

The purpose of this repository is to explore new ways to create word cloud, and compare already existing ways to come up with the one thats not only easy to use but has high functionality and provides good control over all its parameters

This repository is still in progress and so feel free to contribute i.e compe up with even better way to achieve the task or build something entirely from scratch

I have made wordcloud on wikipedia search for the term "Business analytics", using Python, https://tagcrowd.com/, https://worditout.com/word-cloud/create , https://www.wordclouds.com/

First lets preview the output from each of them 

1. Python, with mask as batman, maximum word as 200
